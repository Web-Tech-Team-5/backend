## Project Architecture

This project follows the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** design pattern:

- **Model**: Manages the database schema and handles data logic.
- **View**: There is no direct view in this project since it is a backend project. However, it provides APIs that a frontend application can consume.
- **Controller**: Handles the requests, processes the data, and sends responses to the client.
